People without any reference are not encouraged. People with political affiliation are avoided. Politicking, quarrelsome and argumentative types are rejected.</p>
				<p>All Guards undergo an in-house verification by Rapid Security Service verification team about his/her residential address, previous job experience and other essential credentials before getting registered with the agency.</P>
				<p>We encourage and select people who are honest, humble, committed, courageous and sincere. People with an interest to learn more are given preference. People with too much personal and domestic problems are not given chance to work for us. In short the selected people will be taking their jobs seriously and give their best.</p>
				<p>Select through prompt reference.
<br>Select through prompt interview process.
<br>Verified by our verification team.
